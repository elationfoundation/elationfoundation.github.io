Hello, there. I’m seamus tuohy. I’m a technologist and researcher in Washington DC.

My focus' include the intersection between human rights and technology; supporting free access and exchange of knowledge; Internet measurement and research; and censorship circumvention, privacy, and security practices and tools. I also have a deep interest in the coordinated collection and sharing of threat information.
