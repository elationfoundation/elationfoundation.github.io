I have benefited greatly from access to open-source training curricula in the international information security for human rights defender community. In an attempt to give back I will be open-sourcing some of my own training materials. I hope these resources prove useful to the network information security trainers, facilitators, and technologists supporting communities in complex and hostile environments worldwide.

I did not want to fall into the trap of never releasing this content because I wanted to wait until the "content was ready." As such, these materials are being released *as is.*

# A Three Session Training on Risk Management for advocacy communities

**Brief:** I believe that security for your most sensitive information is strongest when you have the power to make decisions based on a concrete understanding of the risks involved. These sessions are a combination of practical trainings on risk management, discussions about how these topics relate to the realities you experience in your organizations, and some sample exercises you can complete to strengthen your risk assessment decision making. These sessions provide a framework for organizations within your community to assess and manage both their existing risks and the risks that may come with new endeavors.

## Session 1: Talking about Risk

**Duration:** 2 Hours

**Type:** Activity, Lecture, and Discussion

An introduction to risk managements core concepts, to the outputs and outcomes of the sessions, and how risk assessment can fit into an advocacy communities overarching work. This intro is primarily aimed at:
- Building a shared language that will allow participants to communicate back their learnings and findings from the sessions to the larger community; and
- Gaining familiarity with the core concepts involved in assessing and responding to risk.

### Materials To Prepare

Organizational risk management standard for Australia and New Zealand.

##### Risk Assessment In Practice: COSO

- <https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Governance-Risk-Compliance/dttl-grc-riskassessmentinpractice.pdf>

I like this financially focused risk assessment document because it does a better job than many other risk management documents at looking at the process of making decisions that weigh both the risks and the opportunities that come from taking those risks.

##### A practical guide to risk assessment: How principles-based risk assessment enables organizations to take the right risks: PWC

- <https://web.actuaries.ie/sites/default/files/erm-resources/risk_assessment_guide_pwc_dec08.pdf>

##### Security To Go: EISF

- <https://www.eisf.eu/library/security-to-go-a-risk-management-toolkit-for-humanitarian-aid-agencies/>

This set of short security risk management modules are focused on international humanitarian aid agencies. But, they do a great job of simplifying the various components of risk management into easily implementable activities. I would recommend taking a look and reading the ones that seem relevant.


##### Risk Register Blank Template: EISF

- <https://www.eisf.eu/library/blank-risk-register-template-ngos-and-risk/>

A risk register excel template that includes guidance on how to use it. It is a highly structured template that is focused on international security. But, it can be useful even if you don't fill in all the different components.

### Incident & Crisis Management

##### Security Incident Information Management Handbook: EISF

- <https://www.eisf.eu/library/security-incident-information-management-handbook/>

This handbook came out last month and is easily the best handbook on how to collect, track, manage, and share information about threats, risks, security controls, and incidents among Civil Society and NGO actors. It is long but full of valuable content.


##### Template: Computer Security Incident Response Plan: Alan Watkins

- <https://www.peerlyst.com/posts/resource-free-computer-security-incident-response-plan-templates-alan-watkins>

These Small & Medium Business focused incident response plan template(s) are a great starting point for developing your own incident response plans. They are more exhaustive than I would recommend at first.  But, I HIGHLY recommend at least looking through the Appendices. These include a variety of easy to customize templates to support your own incident management efforts.
